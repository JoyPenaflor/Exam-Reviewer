Grade 8 - Quarter 2 Review

- Aerators in fish farming are used to increase oxygen levels in the water.  
- Aquaculture is the breeding, rearing, and harvesting of fish in controlled environments.  
- Aquaponics is the practice of growing fish and plants together in a symbiotic environment.  
- Artificial breeding techniques in aquaculture help increase fish population and improve breeding efficiency.  
- Bangus (Milkfish) is a native fish species of the Philippines.  
- Biofilters in aquaculture help remove waste and harmful substances from water.  
- Brackish water fish species include Bangus.  
- Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) oversees fisheries and aquatic resources in the Philippines.  
- Cage culture is a method of raising fish in large enclosed areas in open water.  
- Clean water is essential for successful fish growth in aquaculture.  
- Dissolved oxygen meter is used to monitor oxygen levels in fish ponds.  
- Disease management in aquaculture is crucial to prevent disease outbreaks and losses.  
- Eco-tourism is not a key relation between aquaculture and fisheries, but food production is.  
- Fisheries law (RA 10654) focuses on the protection and conservation of fisheries resources.  
- Fish farming is a form of aquaculture.  
- Fish hatcheries are important to produce young fish for restocking.  
- Fish species raised in freshwater farms include Tilapia.  
- Freshwater fish species include Tilapia.  
- Harvesting is the final phase of fish culture.  
- Hatchery phase in fish culture involves breeding.  
- Hydroponics is not the same as aquaponics, as it does not involve fish.  
- Implementing responsible aquaculture practices ensures sustainability in fish farming.  
- Implementing sustainable fishing methods helps prevent overfishing.  
- Integrated aquaculture systems commonly use Tilapia.  
- Land reform and air safety are not related to aquaculture, but fisheries law is.  
- Larval fish require live feed for proper growth.  
- Live feed is the most suitable type of feed for larval fish.  
- Marketing offers career opportunities in aquaculture.  
- Mackerel is not a native fish species of the Philippines, but Bangus is.  
- Mudfish naturally inhabits swamps.  
- Net fishing is commonly used for catching fish in open waters.  
- Occupational hazards in aquaculture include water pollution and disease outbreaks.  
- Oxygen levels are the most critical water parameter for fish survival.  
- Overcrowding and poor water quality negatively affect fish farming.  
- Overfishing and illegal fishing do not promote sustainability in fisheries, but proper resource management does.  
- pH meter is used to measure water quality in fish farming.  
- Parallel fishing practices do not include handpicking, but net fishing is common.  
- Pelleted feed is not the best option for larval fish, but live feed is.  
- Philippine law RA 10654 protects fisheries resources.  
- Pollution and disease outbreaks are common challenges in aquaculture.  
- Proper resource management ensures sustainability in fisheries.  
- Providing clean water is crucial for maintaining fish health in aquaculture.  
- RA 10654 focuses on fisheries law and the conservation of aquatic resources.  
- Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) provide sustainable and controlled water conditions.  
- Reservoirs and swamps are not the ideal habitat for sardines, but the open sea is.  
- Salinity is a water parameter, but oxygen levels are the most critical for fish survival.  
- Sardines thrive best in the open sea.  
- Sorting fish for market sale is called harvesting.  
- Sustainable fish farming relies on responsible aquaculture practices.  
- Sustainable fishing methods help prevent overfishing.  
- Swamps are the natural habitat of mudfish.  
- The best method for sustainability in fish farming is responsible aquaculture practices.  
- The Department of Agriculture (DA) does not directly oversee fisheries, but BFAR does.  
- Thermometer is used to measure water temperature in fish ponds.  
- Tilapia is a fish species commonly raised in fish pens and freshwater fish farms in the Philippines.  
- Tilapia is a freshwater fish, while Tuna is a saltwater fish.  
- Tuna and sardines do not live in freshwater, but Tilapia does.  
- Water pollution from excess nutrients is a major environmental impact of improper fish farming.  
- Water pollution negatively affects aquaculture.  
- Water quality monitoring is essential for successful aquaculture operations.  
- Weighing scales are not used to monitor water quality, but pH meters are.
